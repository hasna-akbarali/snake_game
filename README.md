# Snake Game

## Description

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food to grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using the arrow keys. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Features

- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys (Up, Down, Right, Left).
- Food randomly appears on the screen for the snake to eat.
- Score is displayed on the screen and increments when the snake eats food.
- Game resets if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `main.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Right, Left) to control the snake's direction.
3. Try to eat the food to increase your score.
